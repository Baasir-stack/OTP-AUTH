APIs follow standard practices for user authentication and email verification. Here’s how they align with common standards:

1. **Signup API**:

   - **Checks for required fields**: Ensures all necessary data is provided.
   - **Checks if the user already exists**: Avoids duplicate registrations.
   - **Sends a verification email**: Encourages email verification before login.
   - **Provides a clear response**: Indicates success or failure.

2. **Verify Email API**:

   - **Validates the token**: Ensures the token is correct and not expired.
   - **Updates user status**: Marks the email as verified and clears the token.
   - **Sends a welcome email**: Optional, but useful for user engagement.

3. **Login API**:

   - **Checks user existence and password validity**: Verifies credentials.
   - **Checks email verification status**: Ensures only verified users can log in.
   - **Generates a token and sets a cookie**: For authentication purposes.
   - **Provides appropriate responses**: Handles both successful and failed login attempts.

4. **Logout API**:

   - **Clears the authentication cookie**: Logs the user out.

5. **Forgot Password API**:

   - **Generates a reset token**: Allows the user to reset their password.
   - **Sends a reset email**: Contains a link for password reset.

6. **Reset Password API**:

   - **Validates the reset token**: Ensures the token is valid and not expired.
   - **Updates the password**: Resets the user’s password and clears the token.
   - **Sends a success email**: Optional, but confirms the password reset.

7. **Check Auth API**:
   - **Verifies the user’s authentication**: Ensures the user is authenticated and provides user data without sensitive information like passwords.

### Key Points

- **Email Verification**: Users must verify their email before logging in. This is a standard practice to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the authenticity of the user.
- **Password Management**: Secure password storage and reset mechanisms are in place.
- **Token Management**: Both JWT tokens for login and reset tokens for password recovery are used appropriately.
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages are provided for different failure scenarios, which helps in debugging and improving the user experience.

These practices align with common security standards and provide a good user experience. If you have any specific requirements or additional features, you might need to make further adjustments.
